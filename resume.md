I am a life-long programmer with over a decade of professional experience working primarily on web-based enterprise software-as-a-service across multiple industries, from real estate management to precision agriculture, digital media distribution, and more.

I work full-stack, from back-end database and code to front-end functionality and design. My top priority is building systems that stand the test of time, focusing on quality, extensibility, and maintainability.

I'm not a "move fast and break things" developer; I prefer being part of a team that takes a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to architecture and implementation, aiming to avoid the most common pitfalls that deteriorate a software system's long-term health.
