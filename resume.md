# Steve Niles - Senior Enterprise Software Developer
Toronto, Ontario, Canada  
steve.niles@gmail.com  

I am a life-long programmer with over a decade of professional experience working primarily on web-based enterprise software-as-a-service across multiple industries, from real estate management to precision agriculture, digital media distribution, and more.

I enjoy working with a team on both high-level architecture and implementation, as well as testing and documentation. I work full-stack, from back-end database and code to front-end functionality and design. I also have prior experience building desktop applications (mostly in the WinForms era).

My passion is for creating healthy, long-lasting software systems. Quality craftsmanship is very important to me. I have been on a personally funded sabbatical for over a year, and am looking for a new endeavor with a team that also feels strongly about building great software that stands the test of time.
