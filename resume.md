As a developer with a focus on software's long-term health, I place strong emphasis on the principles that lead to sustained quality and maintainability, while avoiding the anti-patterns that make a system buggy, inflexible, and difficult to build upon.  
Knowing when to prioritize, for example, *single responsibility* over *DRY code*, or when to take on (and pay back) tech debt, and when not to, are among the ingredients that create software which stands the test of time.
